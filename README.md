# AI Engineering Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of hands-on AI engineering projects completed as part of the Turing College program. Each project demonstrates practical use of large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, function calling, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and autonomous agent workflows — built using tools like OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit.

## Projects Overview

### Sprint 1: Interview Practice Agent
